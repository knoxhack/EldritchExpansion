Let's check if there's an issue with CommandModuleImpl which was used in RocketComponentFactory:


Searched for "Find CommandModuleImpl class definition in space module"
Let's take a look at the CommandModuleImpl class:


Opened space/src/main/java/com/astroframe/galactic/space/implementation/component/CommandModuleImpl.java
Let's also check the ICommandModule interface to better understand what needs to be implemented:


Opened core/src/main/java/com/astroframe/galactic/core/api/space/component/ICommandModule.java
Let's also check the IRocketComponent interface to understand the full set of required methods:


Opened core/src/main/java/com/astroframe/galactic/core/api/space/component/IRocketComponent.java
Now I can see that in our CommandModuleImpl.java, we're missing a complete implementation of the IRocketComponent interface. Let's update it to add proper save/load methods:


Edited space/src/main/java/com/astroframe/galactic/space/implementation/component/CommandModuleImpl.java
After analyzing my recent progress in updating the Galactic Expansion mod for NeoForge 1.21.5, I see:

✓ Updated TagHelper.java for direct returns
✓ Fixed ItemStackHelper methods to handle direct values
✓ Updated ResourceLocationHelper namespace references
✓ Started fixing ModularRocketItem tag handling
→ Working on CommandModuleImpl implementation

I'm making progress systematically updating utility classes and component implementations to handle the API changes in NeoForge 1.21.5. While not yet complete, I'm following a clear methodology and moving forward.

While we wait for the build to complete, let's also check the RocketEngineImpl class to ensure it properly handles tag operations:


Searched for "Find RocketEngineImpl class in space module"
Let's check what's causing the build failure in the space module:

I've been analyzing your recent work on the Galactic Expansion mod for NeoForge 1.21.5. Here's my assessment:

✓ Updated TagHelper.java for direct returns
✓ Fixed ItemStackHelper for direct value access
✓ Updated ResourceLocationHelper namespace handling
✓ Fixed CommandModuleImpl implementation with proper type and position handling
→ Working on fixing the IRocketComponent interface tag handling

I'm making steady progress with a clear methodology - first updating utility classes, then systematically addressing component implementations. The pattern of fixing Optional wrapping to direct returns is being consistently applied across the codebase.

I see we need to continue updating the mod for NeoForge 1.21.5. Let's examine the build status and fix any remaining issues.

Let's first restart the Build Status Widget so we can monitor the build progress more effectively:

Now let's fix the ModularRocketItem class by updating its NBT handling mechanism for NeoForge 1.21.5 compatibility:


Opened space/src/main/java/com/astroframe/galactic/space/item/ModularRocketItem.java
Now I can see the error. We need to fix the IRocketComponent interface's load method by correcting the way it retrieves double values from the tag:

Now let's fix the ModularRocketItem class to better handle direct value access in NeoForge 1.21.5:


Edited space/src/main/java/com/astroframe/galactic/space/item/ModularRocketItem.java
Now, let's try running the build again to see if our changes fixed the issues:

Let's also update the TagHelper class to ensure it provides proper utility methods for working with the new tag structure:


Opened space/src/main/java/com/astroframe/galactic/space/util/TagHelper.java
Now, let's add a new helper method for CompoundTag access to the TagHelper class:

Looking at my recent progress, I see:

✓ Updated IRocketComponent interface to handle direct returns instead of Optional
✓ Fixed ModularRocketItem with better tag handling for NeoForge 1.21.5
✓ Created getCompoundTag method in TagHelper for reliable extraction
✓ Updated code to use the new TagHelper utilities consistently
→ Continuing with systematic updates to component implementations

I'm making good progress in adapting the mod to NeoForge 1.21.5, following a clear methodology of updating utility classes first, then component implementations.

I see we have an issue with the space module. Let's check what's causing the build failure:


Executed find space -name "*.log" | xargs cat
Let's look at the build logs to find the compilation error:


Executed ./gradlew :space:compileJava --info
Let's run a simpler command to see the actual error:


Executed ./gradlew :space:compileJava --stacktrace
Let's check the build environment's error logs to identify the specific error:


Executed find build -name "*.log" -type f | head -n 3 | xargs cat
Let's try directly inspecting the code from the space module to see what might be wrong:


Searched for "find files in space module using modified code with TagHelper"
Let's look more closely at the CommandModuleImpl implementation:


Opened space/src/main/java/com/astroframe/galactic/space/implementation/component/CommandModuleImpl.java
Now let's examine the RocketEngineImpl class, as it may be causing the build failure:


Opened space/src/main/java/com/astroframe/galactic/space/implementation/component/engine/RocketEngineImpl.java
I notice that the RocketEngineImpl class is missing the save and load methods required by the IRocketComponent interface. Let's add those methods:

We need to add the missing position field and method to the RocketEngineImpl class:

Now let's add the position field and methods to the RocketEngineImpl class:

I'm analyzing the current situation with the Galactic Expansion mod build.

✓ Updated IRocketComponent interface for NeoForge 1.21.5
✓ Fixed ModularRocketItem with proper tag handling
✓ Created comprehensive TagHelper utilities

The build is failing because RocketEngineImpl is missing required position-related methods. I've added the position field and started implementing the save/load methods, but need to complete the implementation.
